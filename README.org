* erc-highlight-nicknames
This package provides a way to highlight nicknames in ERC (an Emacs IRC client)
in a way that respects your colourscheme. The colours can be customized by pressing
`M-x customize-apropos-faces RET erc RET' and by scrolling down to the "fg" colours.

It is based off of the original erc-highlight-nicknames.el found at
[[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/erc-highlight-nicknames.el]].

** Usage
Load erc-highlight-nicknames.el, and add `highlight-nicknames' to erc-modules:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'erc-modules 'highlight-nicknames)
(erc-update-modules)
#+end_src
